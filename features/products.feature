Feature: Products
  In order to access product resources
  As an API client
  I need to be able to retrieve them trough the API

  Scenario: Retrieve a collection of products
    Given the following products exist:
      | model     | brand   | storage | color  | price   | description |

      | iphone X  | apple   | 128     | silver | 1089.99 | new model   |
    When I add "Accept" header equal to "application/hal+json"
    And I send a "GET" request to "/api/products"
    Then the response status code should be 200
    And the response should be in JSON
    And the header "Content-Type" should be equal to "application/hal+json; charset=utf-8"
    And the JSON should be equal to:
